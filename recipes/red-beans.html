    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sort and rinse the red beans.</strong> Cover the beans with cold water about 2 inches above the beans. Let the beans soak overnight. Drain and rinse the beans under cold before cooking them.</li>
        <li><strong>Place the ham hocks,</strong> 9 cups of water, celery, yellow onions, green bell peppers, bay leaves, and seasonings in a 6- quart sizeable Dutch oven; stir the mixture well. Cover the Dutch Oven with a tight-fitting lid and bring to a full boil over high heat. Remove the cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Raise the heat and boil, occasionally stirring, until the meat is fork-tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove the ham hocks</strong> from the Dutch Oven and set them to the side. (Shred the ham hocks while waiting)</li>
        <li><strong>Add the drained and rinsed beans</strong> and 4 cups of the water to the Dutch Oven; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Next, add two more cups of water</strong> and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring often. Add the sliced andouille sausage and continue simmering for about 25-35 minutes, Stirring the bottom of the Dutch oven to ensure the beans do not stick.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the shredded ham hocks</strong> to the Dutch Oven and cook and stir for 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve over long-grain rice</strong> and add Louisiana hot sauce and green scallions for a little more kick.</li>
